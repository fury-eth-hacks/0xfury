# 0xFury Smart Contract Wallet with Account Abstraction

# Project Name

Most of the wealth is stuck in the TradFi owned by our aunties and uncles. They want to invest in the high-yield DeFi but are struggling with the user experience of web3. To make web3 inclusive for everyone, we need to onboard AMAs to the web3 wallet.
